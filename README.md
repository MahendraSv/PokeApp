# PokeApp
Being a lover of pokemon, I wanted to utilize a pokemon api I found to create an app of sorts. This project will evolve over time. Stay tuned...

### Installation
- `homebrew`
- Node `brew install nodejs`
- React Native Command Line Tools `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- Xcode
- `react-native run-ios` from with the project

### Stack
- React Native
- node-fetch for api calls
- http://pokeapi.co for all the pokemon data

### Future Ideas
- Create a list of types to choose from and generate 5 random pokemon
- Connect database for favorting
- Leave a suggestion if you have any!


### Initial Functionality
