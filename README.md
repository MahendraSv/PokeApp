# PokeApp

Being a lover of pokemon, I wanted to utilize a pokemon api I found to create an app of sorts. This project will evolve over time. Stay tuned...

### Stack
- React Native
- node-fetch for api calls
- http://pokeapi.co for all the pokemon data

### Future Ideas
1. Create a list of types to choose from and generate 5 random pokemon
2. Connect database for favorting
3. Leave a suggestion if you have any!
